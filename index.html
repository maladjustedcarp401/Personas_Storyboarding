          <li>
            The interface’s purpose is to allow users of the 3D printer a visual way to print their files, calibrate the printer, and edit the printer's configuration/settings all on the printer itself without needing another computer or device.
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>The knob allows you to scroll between options, but is also the “Ok” button as it can be pushed down</li>
            <li>The X button is a reset button, resetting the printer to the main menu</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>

    <h2> Part 2 </h2>

    <h4>Some user observations include:</h4>
    <div class="observations">
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>Was not clear that the text in the “Print from SD” option are file names. Many file names also do not fit in the screen
          </li>
          <li>Most new users of the printer (and experienced 3D printer users) got stuck on the main menu for a while because they did not realize the knob was also a button
          </li>
          <li>Users became concerned on the main menu because when turning the knob it would change some of the numbers of the main menu, but not really indicate what exactly was being changed
            <ul>
              <li>This usually happened when users were trying each component hoping one of them would leave the main menu (before they realized the knob could be pushed down)
              </li>
              <li>
                It seems to be changing target temperature
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Once in the options menu, there was confusion between scrolling to the “back” option and pressing the knob button vs hitting the reset button
            <ul>
              <li>Users would first hit the reset button, bringing them back to the main menu after a loading screen
              </li>
              <li>This annoyed a lot of the users as they had to start over from where they were before
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The X button has become the “panic” button to press when anything with the U.I or print goes wrong
          </li>
        </ul>

    <div class="observations">
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>Generally having been taught from a BDW mentor or having used another 3D printer before helped with using the printer, but surprisingly a lot of the following issues still happened to these users <span class="questionReference">(1 & 2)</span>
          </li>
          <li>Generally for users both familiar with 3D Printers and unfamiliar the X button was a pain point. Users were confused if it was a back button or ok button and wasted a lot of time clicking it. It is actually a reset button which barely ever has to be pressed <span class="questionReference">(4)</span>
          </li>
          <li>When trying to leave the main menu users ended up using the reset button above or turning the knob because it was not obvious that the knob was a button. It took users about a minute to realize that it was a button
          </li>
         <li>When a print is having issues, the user's first instinct is to hit the X button. This makes it had to diagnose a problem because it goes to the main menu, and there are other ways to safely stop a print that are not obvious <span class="questionReference">(6)</span>
          </li>
          <li>Users found the main menu to be cluttered with text and numbers, and it was not clear how the knob affected them. Experienced users were more comfortable with ignoring this screen, whereas new users became very worried. <span class="questionReference">(3 & 7)</span>
